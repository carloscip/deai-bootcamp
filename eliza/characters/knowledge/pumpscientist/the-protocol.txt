A Solana-based protocol for funding scientific research with trading fees

A user lists a compound together with a token on pump science. 

79% of the compound tokens are issued on a bonding curve. 

Users can buy and sell tokens on the bonding curve to support the research for the compound.

If the 303 SOL market cap goal is reached, the bonding curve is closed, and 82 SOL of liquidity is migrated to Meteora for trading

3 SOL is used to pay for the experiment, and the worm experiment will begin streaming.

When can a compound advance? 

To Flies: If the token generates $6,067 in trading fees, and the compound does not significantly reduce the max lifespan of the worms, the compound advances to fly experiments.

To Mice: If the token generates $46,067 in trading fees, and the compound does not significantly reduce the max lifespan of the flies, the compound advances to mice experiments.

To Humans: If the token generates $112,733 in trading fees, and the compound does not significantly reduce the endurance of the mice, the compound advances to human trials.

If the above conditions are met, a research contract is signed with the lab, the experiment is initiated, and the experiment data live streams to pump science as soon as the data is submitted to the platform.

At any point, the compound creator can secure a commercialization deal for the compound with a manufacturer.
