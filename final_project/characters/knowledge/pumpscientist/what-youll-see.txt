data from inside the pump.science lab

Homepage - Mission Control 
The pump.science app is your cockpit for the longevity game. The homepage is split into three sections: 

Launching: Compound tokens with a live bonding curve that have not yet reached their funding goal to start worm experiments. 

Live: Displays compound tokens that have bonded and currently have an active experiment. 

Advancing: Shows compound tokens that have completed their current experiments and are waiting to advance to the next phase of testing.

Launching
Here you will find the new compound tokens that are just entering the longevity game. Each compound card represents a new compound with an active bonding curve and displays: 

Funding Progress: A bar showing how close the token is to the 303 SOL goal‚Äîat which point the bonding curve graduates, and the worm experiment begins.

Research Contract Status: Displays the current status and key details of the contract with the research organization managing the worm experiment.

Safety Status: Indicates whether the compound has passed preliminary safety reviews.

with a live bonding curve 
Clicking on a compound card takes you to an interface where you can view detailed funding information, real-time token pricing, and most importantly the dynamic fee status. 


Trading view for a compound with an active bonding curve
remember:  the dynamic fee can be very high (up to 99.99% in the first 150 slots or two minutes) to deter bots. always check the fee before buying. 


Dynamic fee statu showing the token is at a standard fee level of 1%
Live 
Displays compound tokens that have bonded and have active experiments underway. Each compound card in this section shows:

Compound Name and Ticker (like $RIF for Rifampicin)

Market Cap

Percent Completed: How far along the experiment is

Animal Model icon: What animal type is being tested (ü™± for worms, ü™∞ for flies, or üêÅ for mice) 

Click on a card to view the detailed data feed for that experiment.

experiments that are ~20% complete.
Advancing
Shows compounds that have completed their current experiments and are waiting to move on to the next phase of testing.

Here you can review historical data on how these compounds performed in their last experiment. 

Inside the Lab - Detailed Trading and Data View
When you click on a compound card (from the live tab), you enter the lab. Here, you will find two main views:

Trading View
In this view you will find an interface designed to trade the compound token with information including: 

Real-Time Trading Metrics: Shows the token's price, trading volume, and market cap. 

Trading Interface: A straightforward way to buy or sell the compound token as new data emerges from the experiments.

Data View
Visual feeds, graphs, and tables provide a quick snapshot of how the compound is performing compared to control in active experiments. 


The different components of the pump.science experiment view.
Experimental Feeds

Worms:

Images released at regular intervals show worm movement with AI tracking their survival.

Note: Worm studies are pre-recorded and replayed at 3x speed (a 30-day experiment compressed into 10 days). 

Flies:

Live video clips (7 minutes each, uploaded hourly) show fly behavior and survival in test vs. control tubes.

Mice:

Weekly endurance tests track how long mice can stay on a rotating rod. 

The metric to watch is latency, which is recorded over multiple trials and averaged to assess endurance.

Charts: Offer a visual comparison between test and control groups.

Data Tables: provide detailed numbers for those who want to see exact results.

Additional Details: environmental conditions, compound dosage, a short compound description, and options to chat or review research agreements.

PhDegen Mode Experimental Charts
For those wanting a deeper dive, the Chart tab provides AI-driven analytics:

Key Metrics to Watch:

Count (Worms & Flies): How many test subjects remain alive. a high count usually means better lifespan extension. this is the primary indicator of compound effectiveness.

Speed (Flies): Average movement speed; a drop may signal early fatigue.

Distance (Flies): total distance traveled, which helps gauge overall vitality.

Latency (Mice): the time mice stay on the rotating rod before falling - averaged over multiple trials to measure endurance.

How to Leverage the Data:

Focus on Survival: For worms and flies, a higher count is a clear indicator that the compound is extending lifespan.

Spot Early Declines: Watch for falls in speed and distance to detect reduced activity.

Assess Endurance in Mice: Longer latency-to-fall means the compound likely improves motor performance.

Gem Hunt: Combine these metrics to identify the most promising compounds‚Äîyour true longevity gems.
