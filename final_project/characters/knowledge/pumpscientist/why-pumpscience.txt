"Primary Care, the most fundamental discipline of medicine, is being overlooked by a broken system that prioritizes 'sick' care over 'health' care" -Primary Care for America

Why Does pump.science matter

Both the private and public sectors are struggling to increase lifespan and healthspan, despite the rising cost of healthcare. Global medical systems are optimized for treating disease, but not for optimizing health. This is most evident in the USA, where life expectancy is decreasing despite increased healthcare expenditure per capita. There are many potential reasons for this, but let's keep vibes positive and discuss how pump.science can fix it.


To accelerate the prospect of a healthy future, we must develop new financing and scientific systems to de-risk (demonstrate the safety and efficacy of) interventions that help make us healthier. Why?  

Getting drug candidates through the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) is a long, expensive process that is too expensive for most scientists unless they receive significant financing from the private sector (venture capital)

The FDA does not classify aging as a disease, and only approves compounds that treat diseases

Health insurance only pays for compounds that cure diseases, so the private sector typically does not invest into general life-extending compounds, which are not paid for by insurance

Although there are many 'lifestyle' and diet changes that affect our health, chemicals are a powerful, and insufficiently explored tool to harness and optimize our health, not just cure disease.  pump.science attempts to empower individuals to address these largely unsolved problems.
