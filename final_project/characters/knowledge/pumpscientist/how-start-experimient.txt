Compound Information
SMILES string: the chemical descriptor for each compound

Official compound name from Pubchem (i.e. Urolithin A)

Create a dynamic GIF file of the compound (see below)

To make the compound gif, go to Pubchem, find your compound, scroll down to the '3D conformer' section, de-select 'Show Hydrogens', select 'Animate', and get a screen recording of the window. You can convert the resulting movie file to a gif with Cloud Converter.

If your experiment has multiple compounds, or there is no 3D conformer in Pubchem, follow the instructions here.
