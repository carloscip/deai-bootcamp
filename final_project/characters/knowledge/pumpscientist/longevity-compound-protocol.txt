longevity compound protocol
Stage 1: C. elegans Testing

Initial Test

If the compound does not reduce lifespan, and there is sufficient funds for fly testing, proceed to Fly Testing.

If the compound reduces lifespan, proceed to Step 2.

Toxicity Mitigation

Reduce the dosage or replicate the test.

If both attempts (original dose + two follow-ups) confirm toxicity, terminate the compound.

If an attempt shows non-toxicity (does not significantly reduce lifespan), proceed to Step 3.

Replication Requirement for Advancement

Replicate the non-toxic result.

If replication confirms non-toxicity, proceed to Stage 2.

If replication fails, terminate the compound.

Financial Check

If accrued fees are insufficient to pay for experiments, cannot proceed until there are sufficient funds.

Advancement Based on Mortality Milestones

50% Mortality: If there is a significant enrichment of the compound group over the control group, advance prior to the completion of the experiment.

75% Mortality: If there is a significant enrichment of the compound group over the control group, advance prior to the completion of the experiment.

90% Mortality: If there is a significant enrichment of the compound group over the control group, advance prior to the completion of the experiment.

Otherwise, the full experiment must be completed, and the drug cannot significantly reduce maximum lifespan.

Stage 2: Fly Testing
Initial Test

Use a dosage no more than 10x the dosage (mg/kg) of the C. elegans test.

If the compound does not reduce lifespan, proceed to Stage 3.

If the compound reduces lifespan, proceed to Step 2.

Toxicity Mitigation

Modify one of the following:

Reduce dosage, change fly strain, or replicate test conditions

Up to two attempts allowed:

If both confirm toxicity, terminate the compound.

If either attempt shows non-toxicity, proceed to Step 3.

Replication Requirement for Advancement

Replicate the non-toxic result.

If replication confirms non-toxicity, proceed to Stage 3.

If replication fails, terminate the compound.

Financial Check

If accrued fees are insufficient to pay for experiments, cannot proceed until there are sufficient funds.

Stage 3: Mouse Testing
Initial Test

Use a dosage no more than 10x the dosage (mg/kg) of the fly test.

If the compound does not hurt endurance, proceed to Stage 4.

If the compound reduces endurance, proceed to Step 2.

Toxicity Mitigation

Modify one of the following:

Reduce dosage, change mouse strain, or replicate test conditions

Up to two attempts allowed:

If both confirm toxicity, terminate the compound.

If either attempt shows non-toxicity, proceed to Step 3.

Replication Requirement for Advancement

Replicate the non-toxic result.

If replication confirms non-toxicity, proceed to Stage 4.

If replication fails, terminate the compound.

Financial Check

If accrued fees are insufficient to pay for experiments, cannot proceed until there are sufficient funds.

Stage 4: Path to Humans
Compound Type Determination

Natural product/supplement â†’ Proceed to Supplement Path

Everything else â†’ Proceed to GRAS Path

Supplement Path

Conduct a Human Study

If the compound shows no harm to biometrics (VO2max, sleep, etc), move forward to outlicense to manufacturers.

If the compound significantly decreases maximum lifespan, proceed to Step 2.

Experiment Replication

Choose one of the following:

Reduce the dosage or replicate the test.

Up to two attempts allowed:

If both tests confirm negative biometric impact persists, terminate the compound.

If either test shows no harm, proceed to Step 3.

Replication Requirement for Advancement

Replicate the result showing no negative impact to biometrics.

If replication confirms no negative impact to biometrics, proceed to Step 4.

If replication fails or there are insufficient funds, terminate the compound.

Non-Supplement Pathway

Conduct GRAS Studies

Include toxicity and human studies.

If non-toxic, outlicense for development.

If toxic, terminate the compound.

Outlicense to Manufacturers

The commercialization pathway begins once the compound is approved as a new food ingredient or new dietary ingredient, transitioning from scientific to commercial.

If the compound is an approved dietary ingredient or food ingredient, it can be licensed to a manufacturer.
