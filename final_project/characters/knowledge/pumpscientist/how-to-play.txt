how to play the longevity game
If you win, you live longer

The mission is simple: Predict which compounds will help animals live longer by identifying those that consistently extend lifespan across multiple species—from worms to flies, mice, and eventually humans.

How to Play: 
Use the experimental data to spot the compounds that are most effective at extending life.

Watch Experiments Unfold 

Follow data streamed of experiments on pump.science. Every image, video, and metric could be a breadcrumb revealing the next longevity breakthrough. 

See how compounds affect survival and behavior throughout an experiment in worms, flies, mice, and eventually humans. all data is streamed to pump.science. 

Trade Compound Tokens

Each compound being tested in experiments is represented by a token. 

Users can buy and sell tokens based on how well they think the compound is working at extending lifespan. 

Identify the Longevity Gems 

 The best compounds are ones that extend lifespan across different animal models.

Your challenge: use the data to spot which compounds consistently help animals live longer. This could be the next longevity gem. 

Airdrops:

Top-performing compounds in each animal model earn airdrop rewards for token holders. They continue to earn airdrop until another compound performs better. 

Putting It All Together
In the pump science longevity game, hunt for the next longevity gem before your time runs out—because, let's be honest, we're all racing against the clock. On pump.science, you'll watch experiments unfold and use the scientific data on the platform to determine which compound is performing best. buying and selling compound tokens lets you show your support for an intervention.
