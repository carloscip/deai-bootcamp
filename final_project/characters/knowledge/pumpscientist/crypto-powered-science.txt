How pump.science funds research initiatives exclusively through trading volume of tokens launched on Solana

Token Creation and Launch 
Custom Bonding Curve
Each token launch launched on pump.science begins with a custom bonding curve, identical to the parameters used on pump.fun. The bonding curve ensures that tokens start at an initial market cap of ~$5k USD. As liquidity is added, the price increases along the bonding curve, and at a liquidity threshold of 85 SOL, liquidity is migrated to an automated market maker, Meteora.

Migration to AMM and Initiating Research
Once the token’s market cap reaches 303 SOL (Solana’s native cryptocurrency), the bonding curve closes, and: 

82 SOL is migrated to Meteora AMM for trading

3 SOL is used to pay for the first experiment in worms

The worm experiment begins streaming directly to users on pump.science

Dynamic Fees on the Bonding Curve 
pump.science implements a dynamic fee structure to deter sniper bots, which can front-run transactions from average users. This mechanism helps create a more level playing field for participants by discouraging automated exploits during initial token sales.

Bot Deterrence: The dynamic fee structure is specifically designed to reduce front-running by sniper bots.

Early Period Risk: The first 150 slots have an extremely high fee (99.99%), which can severely reduce the number of tokens you receive.

Monitoring Activity: Between slots 150 and 250, the fee rapidly decreases. This is a critical window for purchasing if the token sale is in high demand.

Stay Prepared: If you anticipate a “hot” launch, it’s important to track the slot progression and decide when the fee is acceptable for your bidding strategy.

Potential Early Sell-Out: All tokens may be allocated before reaching slot 250, so plan your bids accordingly to avoid missing out.

Fee Stages

fees on the pump.science bonding curve over time
1. Initial High Fee (First 1000 Slots, ~5 Minutes)

Fee: 99.99%

Impact: For every 10,000 SOL you bid, only 1 SOL worth of tokens is purchased.

Rationale: This extremely high fee is designed to prevent sniper bots from instantly buying up tokens at launch.

User Consideration: Bidding during this period is strongly discouraged unless you are aware of the fee implications.

2. Linear Fee Reduction (1000-2000 Slots, ~5 Minutes)

Fee: Gradually decreases from 99.99% to 1%.

Impact: This is the most active purchase window for highly anticipated (“hot”) tokens.

Rationale: The fee drops linearly, allowing both human users and bots to compete on a more even footing.

User Consideration: Monitor transaction volume and decide at what fee level you are comfortable purchasing. Activity is likely to be high during this window, so timing is crucial for obtaining tokens.

3. Reduced Fee (After 250 Slots)

Fee: Stabilizes at 1%.

Impact: The fee remains at 1% for the remainder of the sale.

Rationale: By this point, the initial rush has subsided, and the fee normalizes.

User Consideration: Tokens may sell out before reaching slot 2000, so if you want to participate, be ready to bid during earlier slots.

Dynamic Fees on the Automated Market Maker

fees on the automated market maker (meteora) over time
1. Initial High Fee (0–10 minutes)
Fee: 15%

Impact: Purchasers in the first 10 minutes pay a relatively high fee. This deters opportunistic “sniping” immediately after launch but still allows early access for those who accept the cost.

Rationale: The elevated fee helps mitigate rapid sellouts or bot-driven speculation during the most volatile launch period. It balances immediate availability with a measure of caution for early participants.

User Consideration: If you want to buy tokens right away, be aware that 15% of your purchase value goes to fees. This window is best suited for those who prioritize immediate ownership over fee savings.

2. Reduced Fee Window (10 minutes - 24 hours)
Fee: 1%

Impact: After 10 minutes, the fee drops substantially to 1%. This makes purchasing more economical.

Rationale: By lowering the fee, more participants can buy in at a more reasonable rate, while still controlling excessive speculation. 

User Consideration: This period may be highly active as users see a good balance between lower fees and relatively early access. 

3.  Long-Term Fee (After 24 hours)
Fee: 0.25%

Impact: Beyond 24 hours, the fee stabilizes at its lowest rate, allowing ongoing trading or purchasing with minimal overhead.

Rationale: A nominal fee encourages broader participation and long-term holding without penalizing latecomers.

User Consideration: If tokens remain available, this is the most cost-effective time to purchase. However, the token’s supply and demand dynamics may have changed substantially since launch. 

How Trading Fees Fund Research Progression
Research is funded through LP fees generated by trading activity.

The migrated liquidity is locked in the Meteora pool; however, LP tokens are not burned.

Instead, claim authority over the LP tokens is granted to pump.science, allowing the platform to use LP fees for research funding.

70% of LP fees go to the research

25% of LP fees go to pump.science as a platform fee

5% of LP fees go to the the compound submitter (dev)

Here are the total fees required to afford experiments in each animal:

To Flies: If the token generates $6,500 in fees, and the compound does not significantly (p < .01) reduce the max lifespan of the worms, the compound advances to flies.

To Mice: If the token generates $50,000 in fees, and the compound does not significantly (p < .01) reduce the max lifespan of the flies, the compound advances to mice.

To Humans: If the token generates $120,000 in fees, and the compound does not significantly (p < .01) reduce the endurance of the mice, the compound advances to humans.

This tokenomics model aligns incentives across traders, researchers, and long-term token holders, creating a sustainable ecosystem for funding scientific discovery.

Airdrop Mechanism
The pump.science airdrop mechanism rewards holders of the best-performing compound in each animal model. 

Here's how it works:
Holders of pump.science tokens for the top-performing compound in a given category receive airdrops from future token launches. 

The allocation is determined on a pro-rata basis—based on the relative value of each wallet's holdings—thereby incentivizing long-term participation in token launches to secure future airdrop rewards.

Token Issuance
1B total supply

793.1M tokens are issued along the bonding curve

Upon migration to the LP, 156.9M tokens and 82 SOL are transferred to the LP

50M tokens are distributed through a Streamflow airdrop pro rata to token holders in the compounds that are the top performer in each animal

The top performing compounds that receive airdrops are below:

Worms (Longevity): Rifampicin, RIF (+32.87%)

Flies (Longevity): Urolithin A, URO (+20.13%)

Mice (Rotarod Latency): TBD

Humans (VO2max): TBD

25% of the airdrop is allocated to each animal, and claiming period is 1 month. If tokens have not been claimed in 1 month, they are burned.
