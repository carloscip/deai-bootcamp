```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:
```bash
API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
STABILITY_KEY=your_stability_ai_key # OPTIONAL
```

## Environment Variables

- `API_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API key for accessing GPT models. You can also use an openai key instead.
- `STABILITY_KEY`: Your Stability AI API key for image generation (optional)

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash

## Project Structure

The project is organized into four main files:

### `main.py`
The entry point of the application. It initializes the terminal UI and starts the main application loop.

### `config.py`
Contains all configuration settings and system messages:
- API endpoints and authentication
- UI constants
- System messages that define the AI assistant's behavior

### `clients.py`
Handles all external API interactions:
- OpenAI chat completions for recipe generation and cooking advice
- Stability AI integration for food image generation
- Error handling and response processing

### `terminal_ui.py`
Manages the terminal user interface:
- Rich text formatting and display
- User input handling
- Conversation history management
- ASCII art generation for images
- Temporary file management

## Notes

- Image generation is optional and will be skipped if no Stability AI API key is provided
- The application stores conversation history in memory during the session
- Temporary image files are automatically cleaned up when the application exits
- The UI is optimized for terminal displays with color support

## Error Handling

The application includes robust error handling for:
- API failures
- Network issues
- Invalid user inputs
- Image generation problems
- File system operations
